# vid-comp

Forked from IgnetStudio's [HTML5 Video Before-and-After Comparison Slider](https://gist.github.com/IgnetStudio/24df33eba887b6d5c21e), this project allows the user to compare between gameplay recording of two different qualities playing simultaneously. I altered the code to fit within a basic HTML page so it could be wrapped in an iframe and easily used on a WordPress post.
